# Retinal-Blood-Vessel-Segmentation-by-Active-Contour
Active contour is a strong method for edge extraction. However, it cannot extract thin vessels and ridges very well. In this project, I implement an enhanced active contour method that uses discrete wavelet transform for energy minimization to solve this problem.
